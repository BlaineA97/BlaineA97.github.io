<h1>Kids fighting against zombie kids: The somewhat unexplored genre.</h1>
<p>Welcome to my Kids fighting kid zombies Page, you can also use <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> for more results!<p>
<p>
While most zombie films, shows, comics and other sources of media may have a couple kids included in the series, its generally left to the adults to manage the group and forge ahead. 
<strong>I find this picture so striking as it leaves those preconcieved notions in the dust.</strong>
These kids have managed to fortify and come together as a group without any "leaders", so to speak.
<em>I hope they win :)</em>

<h2>What makes this original?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You just don't see a lot of "only kids" surviving zombies.</li>
	<li>It takes place on a playground (Terribly Ironic, I know).</li>
	<li>If you look closely, each kid is using a different set of weapons.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What weapons are they using?</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Green and white shirt boy: Uses a lightweight bat and Trashcan lid.</li>
	<li>Pink jacket girl: Uses a slingshot (original for zombies!)</li>
	<li>Red overalls(?) girl: uses a frekin brick.</li>
	<li>Blue jacket boy: Uses, based on the picture, what I can only assume to be a mop?</li>
	<li>Gray jacket unknown gender (behind the green shirt boy): No idea what they use, just that they exist.</li>
</ol>
