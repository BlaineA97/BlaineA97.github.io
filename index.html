  <h2>~Gaming Genres For All~</h2>
   <p>
  	 When Video Games were first introduced, there were fewer categories due (generally) to the resrictions of technology at the time. Now it can be broken down into so many categories that anyone can find something just for them!
   </p>
  <h4>A few examples of Game Categories:</h4>
   <ul>
     <li>RPG</li>
     <li>Puzzle</li>
     <li>FPS</li>
     <li>Platformer</li>
     <li>Fighting</li>
     <li>And many, many more!</li>
   </ul>
