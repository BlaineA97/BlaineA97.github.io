   <p>
  	 When Video Games were first introduced, there were fewer categories due (generally) to the resrictions of technology at the time. Now it can be broken down into so many categories that anyone can find something just for them!
   </p>
  <h4>A few examples of Game Categories:</h4>
   <ul>
     <li>RPG</li>
     <li>Puzzle</li>
     <li>FPS</li>
     <li>Platformer</li>
     <li>Fighting</li>
     <li>Sandbox</li>
     <li>Open World</li>
     <li>Pet Simulator</li>
     <li>Survival</li>
     <li>Adventure</li>
     <li>Compeditive</li>
     <li>Team Based</li>

  <h2>~Recognizable Characters and Brands~</h2>
    <img src="images/sonic_mario.jpg" alt="Sonic Vs Mario" height="300" width="400" border="20">
    <p>Most everyone will at the very least recognize certain major characters from an assortment of Game Titles. The reason for this is they have become so ingrained into our very culture from generations of exposure that it has become commonplace.</p>
    <h3>See if you know any of these characters:</h3>
      <table border="15">
       <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Recognizable Characters</th>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <th>Mario</th>
         <th>Sonic</th>
       </tr>
       <tr>
       	<td><img src="images/char_mario.jpg" alt="An Image of Mario" height="100" width="100"></td>
       	<td><img src="images/char_sonic.jpg" alt="An Image of Sonic" height="100" width="100"></td>
       </tr>
      </table>

 	<h2>~Alternative Site~</h2>
 	  <p>If you <strong>must</strong> go look at another site to compare, I suggest <a href="www.mobygames.com/glossary/genres">this one</a>. It's about as close to talking about Genre and Recognition for gaming as I could find!</p>
 	  <p>Now while it's not my favorite site, it does list a large number of the categories and sub-categoris available in the gaming industy now, with small descriptions of each one, which is rather nice!</p>

   <h6>As some of you could have noticed, if this page source is run through the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">error checker</a> you would notice a number of errors. However, I've left these errors intact as they contribute to the pages design as we do not know CSS yet. Thanks for looking out for me though!</h6>
